# Cat vs Dog Image Classification using CNN

This repository contains a deep learning project that classifies images of cats and dogs using a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The project is part of a learning portfolio to demonstrate practical understanding of image-based classification tasks, model evaluation, and performance optimization techniques in deep learning.
